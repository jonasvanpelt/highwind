0. GENERAL
***********************************************************************/

- All the header files all located in folder header_files

- This are the libraries that I've written:
		- upd_communication.h				to establish client-server UDP communication
		- uart_communication.h				to establish UART communication with lisa
		- data_decode.h						to translate packages coming from lisa to structs and encode server messages to lisa format
		- analyze.h							to analyze the incoming packages on the server (frequency, latency)
		- circular_buffer.h					to use a circular buffer for logging
		- log.h								to log data on beaglebone and to log errors
					
					See header files for more detailed documentation!
		
- All libraries have error handling
		
- The folder contains 4 programs:

/**********************************************************************
1. BEAGLE BONE SOFTWARE FOR THE PLANE
***********************************************************************/

- software that establishes communication between lisa and server
	- one thread for receiving data on UART and sending it to server using UDP
	- one thread for receiving UDP data from server and sending it to lisa using UART
	- one thread to log data coming from lisa
	- one thread to log data coming from server
	
	--> For compiling and running:  sh runBeagle.sh

/**********************************************************************
2. BEAGLE BONE SOFTWARE FOR THE WINDSENSOR
***********************************************************************/


- software that receives data from the windsensor and send it to the server
	- On the UART port the package is received in NMEA ASCII format
	- This ASCII data is first translated to a real structure with real data formats like double
	- After that the package is translated to the default pacakge format that is used by the decoder (sender id, message id, checksums, timestamp, ...)
	- Finally the package is sent to the server using UDP
	
	--> For compiling and running:  sh runWind.sh

/**********************************************************************
3. SERVER SOFTWARE
***********************************************************************/


- software that acts like a test server.
	- one thread for sending servo commands to beaglebone/lisa using UDP
	- one thread to receive UDP data coming from beaglebone
		- decodes data coming from the beaglebone
		- analyzes the packages coming from beaglebone: Calculating latency and frequency of sending
		  After 20 seconds retreiving data the results will be printed to the screen and dumped to a file
	
	--> For compiling and running:  sh runServer.sh


/**********************************************************************
4. READ LOG SOFTWARE
***********************************************************************/

- sofware to read the data that is logged on the SD card on the beaglebone
	
	--> For compiling and running:  sh runReadLog.sh
